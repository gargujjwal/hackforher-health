    myth: "Only Promiscuous Women Get HPV",
    reality: "Any woman who has had sex can have HPV.",
    explanation:
      "Many people believe that only promiscuous women get HPV. But the truth is that any woman who has had sex, even with just one partner, could have been exposed to HPV. HPV is a very common virus. In fact, about eight out of 10 women will have had HPV at some point in time by the age of 50.",

    myth: "A regular Pap test is enough to protect women against cervical cancer.",
    reality:
      "A Pap test alone is not enough to protect women against cervical cancer.",
    explanation:
      "While the Pap test has helped significantly decrease the number of cervical cancer cases in the United States, no test is perfect. Pre-cancerous cells in some women are missed. For women age 30 and older, getting the HPV test along with a Pap increases the ability to identify women at risk to nearly 100 percent. Women under age 30 should get the HPV test if their Pap results are inconclusive.",

    myth: "If you have HPV, you will probably get cervical cancer.",
    reality: "HPV is very common. But cervical cancer is not.",
    explanation:
      "The truth is that having HPV does not mean you have or will get cervical cancer. Most women will be exposed to HPV at some point in their lives, and for most women, HPV infections will go away on their own without causing any problems. But in some women, the infection persists over a long period of time and causes abnormal cells to form, which can then develop into cervical cancer. With HPV testing, women with certain 'high-risk' HPV infections can be identified and monitored carefully. If the HPV infection causes pre-cancerous cell changes, these can be detected and treated early before cervical cancer ever has the chance to develop.",

    myth: "Women with HPV will experience warning symptoms.",
    reality: "HPV infections usually do not cause any symptoms.",
    explanation:
      "Many women think that if they don't have warning signs, they certainly could not have HPV or cervical cancer. This is not true! Although some 'low risk' types of HPV can cause genital warts, the 'high-risk' types that are associated with cervical cancer often go completely undetected â€“ that is, until abnormal cells develop. That's why routine screening with Pap and HPV testing is so important. Symptoms of cervical cancer can include vaginal bleeding or discharge after intercourse, between periods or after sexual intercourse, and pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.",

    myth: "There is nothing I can do to prevent cervical cancer other than Pap or HPV testing.",
    reality:
      "Besides the HPV vaccination, your risk for cervical cancer can be minimized by avoiding certain risk factors.",
    explanation:
      "Besides the HPV vaccination, your risk for cervical cancer can be minimized by avoiding smoking, multiple sexual partners, sexual intercourse at an early age, chlamydia infection, and a weakened immune system or HIV infection.",

    myth: "If a woman gets the HPV vaccine, she no longer needs the Pap or HPV test.",
    reality:
      "Girls and women who get the HPV vaccine will still need to be tested with the Pap test and HPV test.",
    explanation:
      "The HPV vaccine only protects against two of the more than a dozen types of cancer-causing HPV types. Even then, vaccination is only fully effective when given to women who have not yet been exposed to HPV. That means the ideal candidate for the vaccine is an adolescent girl or young woman who is not yet sexually active. The bottom line: All women, including those who are vaccinated, need regular screening with a Pap and (if they are age 30 or older) an HPV test.",

    myth: "It is not possible to prevent cervical cancer",
    reality: "Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancer.",
    explanation:
      "Firstly, the cervical cancer vaccine against the human papillomavirus (HPV) will prevent more than 90% of cervical cancers. Secondly, screening will find abnormal cells on the cervix that are so small and harmless that they can be treated early before they become cancerous.",

      "The vast majority of adults who have been sexually active at least once in their life, would test positive for HPV at least once. It is possible to develop cervical cancer even if you have only had one sexual partner.",

    reality:
      "Having HPV does not always mean you will develop cervical cancer.",
    explanation:
      "Cervical cancer is caused by 'high-risk' types of HPV. There have been more than 100 types of HPV identified and about a dozen types are considered high-risk for developing cervical cancer. In most people, your immune system will clear the virus itself. If the body does not clear the infection and it becomes persistent, high-risk HPV types may develop into cervical cancer.",

    myth: "Cervical cancer is only diagnosed in elderly/young women.",
    reality: "Cervical cancer affects women of all ages.",
    explanation:
      "The Australian Gynaecological Cancer Foundation reports that the average age at diagnosis is about 47 years and 70% of cancers are diagnosed in women under the age of 60 who have not participated in regular cervical cancer screening. While it is rare for cervical cancer to be diagnosed in women under 20 years of age, this disease affects women of all ages.",

    myth: "Cervical cancer is hereditary, and I am unlikely to be diagnosed without a family history.",
    reality:
      "Cervical cancer is not hereditary because it is not caused by an inherited faulty gene; it is caused by the HPV infection.",
    explanation:
      "However, sometimes cervical cancer runs in the family. We think this is because some of the behaviours (smoking) are more common amongst some families than others.",
