    question: "What is cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in a woman's cervix. The cervix is the opening of the uterus. It connects the vagina (or birth canal) to the uterus (womb). Cervical cancer usually starts with changes to the cells on the cervix, called dysplasia. These abnormal cells can be removed to prevent cancer, if found early.",

    question: "What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "In the early stages of cervical cancer there are often no symptoms. The longer a woman has cervical cancer without treatment, the more likely she will have symptoms. Some of the symptoms of later stage cervical cancer can include: Heavy vaginal bleeding or discharge (more than usual), Bleeding after sex, between periods or after a pelvic exam, Pain during sex or urination.",

    question: "What are the risk factors for cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Any woman can get cervical cancer, but some women are at higher risk because of factors such as: Having the Human Papillomavirus Virus (HPV), Not Getting Screened, Smoking, Aging. Other risk factors include: Having been treated before for cervical cancer or for abnormal cells that may become cancer, Using birth control pills for five years or longer, Giving birth three or more times, Having multiple sexual partners, Having HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, or another condition that makes it hard for your body to fight off infections, Having a mother who took DES (diethylstilbestrol) while pregnant with you.",

    question: "How often should I be screened for cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "Women should start cervical cancer screening at 21 years of age. Women ages 21 to 29 years should have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 years have the choice to get a Pap test every three years, a HR HPV test every five years, or a Pap test and HR HPV test every five years.",

    question: "What does it mean to have an abnormal Pap smear?",
    answer:
      "Having an abnormal Pap smear is very common, so don't feel alone. It just means that additional tests are needed to prove that cervical cancer isn't present. Most people with abnormal Pap smear do not end up having a diagnosis of cervical cancer.",

    question:
      "Should I still get the HPV vaccine if I already have cervical pre-cancer?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. After cervical pre-cancer or even HPV exposure, the vaccine remains to provide benefit. We have good evidence to support this. So I recommend HPV vaccination after pre-cancer or even after cervical cancer.",

    question: "Does catching cervical cancer early make a difference?",

    question: "Does cervical cancer impact fertility?",

    question: "How long does it take cervical cancer to develop?",
    answer:
      "It can take years for precancerous changes in the cervix to morph into cervical cancer. Since no two people have the same body type, there’s no general rule of thumb for how long this can take. However, it’s especially important for women to have routine Pap tests so that cancerous changes are detected as soon as possible.",

    question: "What are the stages of cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "The stages of cervical cancer refer to how far it’s spread throughout the body. Cervical cancer stages range from I to IV, with I being less severe and IV being more severe. As a general rule, the more your cancer has spread, the harder it will be to cure.",

    question: "Is cervical cancer curable?",
    answer:
      "Cervical cancer is often curable if it’s found at an early stage. But the longer it goes undetected, the more difficult it becomes to treat. If it spreads to distant organs in the body, the chances of a cure decrease significantly.",

    question: "Can you get cervical cancer after a hysterectomy?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it is possible to get cervical cancer after a hysterectomy, however, it’s generally uncommon. For most women who undergo a hysterectomy the risk of developing cancer or recurrence of cancer is low. That’s why it’s important to schedule annual screenings to catch any abnormalities before they spread.",

    question: "Can you get pregnant if you have cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "If you have cervical cancer, your ability to get pregnant depends largely on what treatment type you receive. Early-stage cervical cancer can usually be treated in ways that preserve your ability to carry a child to term. However, if your treatment involves a hysterectomy, for instance, you will not be able to get pregnant afterward.",

  {
    question: "Can cervical cancer spread?",
    answer:
      "Like all other cancers, cervical cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body if undetected or untreated. Cancer is always named for the place in the body where it originates. So, if cervical cancer spreads to the liver, you don’t have liver cancer, but rather cervical cancer in the liver.",

    question: "Can you get cervical cancer without HPV?",
    answer:
      "Yes. HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer. A number of other risk factors can determine your overall risk of developing cervical cancer. These include, for instance, your history of smoking and whether you have had an HIV infection.",

    question: "Can you feel cervical cancer?",
    answer:
      "Unfortunately, early cervical cancers usually have no clear warning signs. Symptoms don’t often begin to show until cancer becomes larger and spreads to nearby organs or tissue. Painful symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, heavy periods and pain in or around your pelvic region.",
